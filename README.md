# üõ∞Ô∏è TS-CPC: Geometry-Consistent Self-Supervised Trajectory Similarity via Contrastive Predictive Coding

This repository contains the official implementation of **TS-CPC**, a self-supervised trajectory similarity measurement framework based on Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC). TS-CPC is designed to handle complex trajectory datasets efficiently while delivering robust and accurate similarity measurements.

## üîë Key Features
- **Sliding-Window-based Linear Interpolation (SW-LI):** Enhances trajectory features by preserving fine-grained details and improving model performance.  
- **Trajectory Detour Point Offset (TDPO):** Improves robustness against real-world noise and drift.  
- **SFEM (Shallow Feature Extraction Module):** Extracts essential motion dynamics (speed, acceleration, orientation, angular velocity, curvature, etc.) to enrich trajectory representation.  
- **Enhanced CPC module:** Incorporates a principled positive‚Äìnegative sampling strategy to strengthen InfoNCE discrimination and convergence.
